# GoogleDeveloperGroupsTaskRound

A responsive, static website built as part of the recruitment round for GDGC (Google Developer Groups on Campus).  
This project demonstrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and delivers a modern-looking front-end site with avatar placeholders (using sample images from DiceBear) for team/member representation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Clean, semantic HTML structure  
- Responsive design: works across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes  
- Modern styling using CSS (in `styles.css`) — layout, typography, and hover/transition effects  
- Basic interactivity using JavaScript (in `script.js`) — for any dynamic behavior included  
- Usage of placeholder avatars (sourced from DiceBear) in the “team” or “members” section, giving a professional look without custom graphics  
- Organized assets: images stored under `images/`, making maintenance easier

## ✅ How to Run / Preview Locally

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser — it works as a static site (no server needed).  
3. (Optional but recommended) Use a live-server extension (for example with VS Code) so you can live-preview changes, especially if you add JS or edit CSS.

## 🧑‍💻 Possible Improvements (Future Work)

- Add more pages (e.g. About, Contact, Events) to make the site more complete.  
- Enhance accessibility (e.g. `alt` attributes for images, better semantics, responsive images).  
- Improve styling (dark mode, better typography, animations).  
- Add deployment (e.g. host on GitHub Pages / Netlify) and include a “Live Demo” link here.  
- If needed, integrate a backend or a static site generator to automate content addition.
